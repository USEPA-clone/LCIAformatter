  IMPACT World+ version 1.3 is built from LCIA Formatter v0.4 and mappings from the Federal
  Elementary Flow List (FEDEFL) v1.0.4

  IMPACT World+ flowable and context input files are maintained in the FEDEFL GitHub Repository:
  https://github.com/USEPA/Federal-LCA-Commons-Elementary-Flow-List

  The LCIA Formatter (https://github.com/USEPA/LCIAformatter) applies IMPACT World+
  characterization factors to flows using the mapping housed in the FEDEFL.
  The flowable and context input files for IMPACT World+ are used by the LCIA Formatter
  to translate the names from the IMPACT World+ source file (Microsoft Access database) and generate a mapping
  file for the FEDEFL. This file contains the accepted flowable and context
  combinations which can be mapped to IMPACT World+ characterization factors. Regionalized flowables are excluded
  from the output files generated by the LCIA Formatter at this time. The mapping file
  includes target UUID, units, and conversion factors as well as tracking
  who mapped and verified each record and when they were last updated.

  FEDEFL contexts are mapped to IMPACT World+ to enable impact assessment across most
  of the possible contexts available within FEDEFL. Mappings that occur in the
  primary contexts (e.g. air) are assigned to all possible sub-contexts which apply.

  The LCIA Formatter generates a separate midpoint and enpoint impact assement method based on the IMPACT World+
  source file.'
