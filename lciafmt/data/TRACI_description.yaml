    'TRACI2.1 built from Federal Elementary Flow List (FedEFL) v1.0.1.1 and LCIA Formatter v0.2-beta
    
    TRACI2.1 source file:  https://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2015-12/traci_2_1_2014_dec_10_0.xlsx
    
    The LCIA Formatter (https://github.com/USEPA/LCIAformatter) applies TRACI 
    characterization factors to flows using mappings from the FedEFL. 
    
    The FedEFL is populated, in part, using flowables found in TRACI modified to 
    preferred naming conventions sourced from EPA databases such as SRS and 
    ChemDashboard.
    
    Additional flowable mappings were included for general metals (e.g. Copper, Zinc, and Selenium) in 
    the FedEFL to the most common ions where available in TRACI 
    (e.g. COPPER(II), ZINC(II), and SELENIUM(IV)). This ensures the application 
    of TRACI characterization factors when the general name of the metal is 
    reported, as is the case in EPA datasets such as NEI and TRI. 
    
    In some instances, there were duplicate names for flowables in TRACI which 
    had different characterization factors and different CAS. These occurred 
    due to duplicate entries in the source files for USEtox. In these cases, the 
    entries with the currently recognized CAS were accepted and the other flowables 
    were ignored.
    
    FedEFL contexts are mapped to TRACI to enable impact assessment across most 
    of the possible contexts available within FedEFL. Mappings that occur in the 
    primary contexts are assigned to all possible sub-contexts which apply. Where 
    a context is non-specific in FedEFL relative to the available TRACI 
    contexts (e.g. rural/urban), the FedEFL assigns them to a context with a name 
    including the label unspecified and applies an average characterization 
    factor from TRACI.
    
    The current version of TRACI available within the FedEFL repository does not 
    include normalization or weighting factors.
    
    TRACI mapping files are maintained in the Federal LCA Commons Elementary 
    Flow List (FedEFL) GitHub Repository:
