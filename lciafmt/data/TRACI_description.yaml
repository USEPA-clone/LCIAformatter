    'TRACI 2.1 built from LCIA Formatter v0.2-beta and mappings from Federal 
    Elementary Flow List (FEDEFL) v1.0.1.1
    
    TRACI 2.1 source file:
    https://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2015-12/traci_2_1_2014_dec_10_0.xlsx
    
    TRACI 2.1 flowable/context input files are maintained in the FEDEFL GitHub Repository: 
    https://github.com/USEPA/Federal-LCA-Commons-Elementary-Flow-List/tree/master/fedelemflowlist/input
    
    TRACI 2.1 mapping file is maintained in the FEDEFL GitHub Repository: 
    https://github.com/USEPA/Federal-LCA-Commons-Elementary-Flow-List/tree/master/fedelemflowlist/flowmapping

    The LCIA Formatter (https://github.com/USEPA/LCIAformatter) applies TRACI 2.1 
    characterization factors to flows using the mapping housed in the FEDEFL 
    (https://github.com/USEPA/Federal-LCA-Commons-Elementary-Flow-List). 

    The flowable and context input files for TRACI 2.1 are used by the LCIA Formatter 
    to translate the names from the TRACI 2.1 source file and generate a mapping 
    file for the FEDEFL. This file contains all of the accepted flowable and context 
    combinations which can be mapped to TRACI 2.1 characterization factors. It also
    includes source/target UUID, units, and conversion factors as well as tracking
    who mapped and verified each record and when they were last updated.

    Additional flowable mappings were included for general metals (e.g. Copper, Zinc, 
    and Selenium) in the FEDEFL to the most common ions where available in TRACI 2.1 
    (e.g. COPPER(II), ZINC(II), and SELENIUM(IV)). This ensures the application 
    of TRACI 2.1 characterization factors when the general name of the metal is 
    reported, as is the case in EPA datasets such as NEI and TRI. 
    
    In some instances, there were duplicate names for flowables in TRACI 2.1 which 
    had different characterization factors and different CAS. These occurred 
    due to duplicate entries in the source files for USEtox. In these cases, the 
    entries with the currently recognized CAS were accepted and the other flowables 
    were ignored.
    
    FEDEFL contexts are mapped to TRACI 2.1 to enable impact assessment across most 
    of the possible contexts available within FEDEFL. Mappings that occur in the 
    primary contexts are assigned to all possible sub-contexts which apply. Where 
    a context is non-specific in FEDEFL relative to the available TRACI 2.1 
    contexts (e.g. rural/urban), the FEDEFL assigns them to a context with a name 
    including the label unspecified and applies an average characterization 
    factor from TRACI 2.1.

    The current version of TRACI 2.1 available within the FEDEFL repository does not 
    include normalization or weighting factors.
