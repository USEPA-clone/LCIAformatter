    'TRACI2.1 - FedEFL Version 1.0.1.1
    TRACI source file:  https://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2015-12/traci_2_1_2014_dec_10_0.xlsx
    TRACI mapping files are maintained in the Federal LCA Commons Elementary Flow List GitHub Repository: https://github.com/USEPA/Federal-LCA-Commons-Elementary-Flow-List/tree/master/fedelemflowlist/input

    The TRACI’s characterization factors are applied using the mapping from the FedEFL during the creation of the TRACI JSON file output from USEPA’s LCIA Formatter GitHub Repository: https://github.com/USEPA/LCIAformatter
    
    The FedEFL is populated, in part, using TRACI flowables mapped with 
    preferred naming conventions sourced from EPA databases such as SRS and 
    ChemDashboard. The characterization factors from TRACI are then applied 
    to each applicable flow (i.e. flowable/context combination) in the FedEFL.
    
    Additional flowable mappings were added from general metals (e.g. Copper, Zinc, and Selenium) in the FedEFL to the most common ions where available in TRACI (e.g. COPPER(II), ZINC(II), and SELENIUM(IV)). This ensures the application of TRACI characterization factors when the general name of the metal is reported, as is the case in EPA datasets such as NEI and TRI. In some instances, there were duplicate names for flowables in TRACI which had different characterization factors and different CAS. These occurred due to duplicate entries in the source files for USEtox. In these cases, the entries with the currently recognized CAS were accepted and the other flows were renamed so they would not map to the FedEFL.
    FedEFL contexts are mapped to TRACI to enable impact assessment across most of the possible contexts available within FedEFL. Mappings that occur in the primary contexts are assigned to all possible sub-contexts which apply. Where a context is non-specific in FedEFL relative to the available TRACI contexts (e.g. rural/urban), the FedEFL assigns them to a context with a name including the label unspecified and applies an average characterization factor from TRACI.
    The current version of TRACI available within the FedEFL repository does not include normalization or weighting factors.'
