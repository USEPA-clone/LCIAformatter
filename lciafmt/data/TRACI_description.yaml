    'TRACI 2.1 is built from LCIA Formatter v0.2-beta and mappings from the Federal 
    Elementary Flow List (FEDEFL) v1.0.1.1
    
    TRACI 2.1 source file: 
    https://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2015-12/traci_2_1_2014_dec_10_0.xlsx
    
    TRACI 2.1 flowable and context input files are maintained in the FEDEFL GitHub Repository: 
    https://github.com/USEPA/Federal-LCA-Commons-Elementary-Flow-List 
    
        
    The LCIA Formatter (https://github.com/USEPA/LCIAformatter) applies TRACI 2.1 
    characterization factors to flows using the mapping housed in the FEDEFL. 
    The flowable and context input files for TRACI 2.1 are used by the LCIA Formatter 
    to translate the names from the TRACI 2.1 source file and generate a mapping 
    file for the FEDEFL. This file contains all of the accepted flowable and context 
    combinations which can be mapped to TRACI 2.1 characterization factors. It also
    includes target UUID, units, and conversion factors as well as tracking
    who mapped and verified each record and when they were last updated.


    Additional flowable mappings were included for general metals (e.g. Copper, Zinc, 
    and Selenium) in the FEDEFL to the most common ions where available in TRACI 2.1 
    (e.g. COPPER(II), ZINC(II), and SELENIUM(IV)). This ensures the application 
    of TRACI 2.1 characterization factors when the general name of the metal is 
    reported, as is the case in EPA datasets such as NEI and TRI. 

    
    Duplicate names for flowables exist in TRACI 2.1 which have different 
    characterization factors and different CAS. These occur due to duplicate 
    entries in the source files for USEtox. In these cases, the entries with 
    the currently recognized CAS are accepted and the other flowables are ignored.

    
    FEDEFL contexts are mapped to TRACI 2.1 to enable impact assessment across most 
    of the possible contexts available within FEDEFL. Mappings that occur in the 
    primary contexts (e.g. air) are assigned to all possible sub-contexts which apply. 
    Where a context is non-specific in FEDEFL relative to the available TRACI 2.1 
    contexts (e.g. rural/urban), the LCIA Formatter applies the average of the 
    relevant characterization factors from TRACI 2.1.


    Normalization and weighting factors are not provided in the TRACI 2.1 source 
    file and are not added here.'
