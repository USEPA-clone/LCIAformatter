    'ReCiPe2016 is built from LCIA Formatter v0.4-beta and mappings from the Federal 
    Elementary Flow List (FEDEFL) v1.0.2

    ReCiPe 1.1 flowable and context input files are maintained in the FEDEFL GitHub Repository: 
    https://github.com/USEPA/Federal-LCA-Commons-Elementary-Flow-List 
    
   
    The LCIA Formatter (https://github.com/USEPA/LCIAformatter) applies ReCiPe 1.1 
    characterization factors to flows using the mapping housed in the FEDEFL. 
    The flowable and context input files for ReCiPe 1.1 are used by the LCIA Formatter 
    to translate the names from the ReCiPe 1.1 source file and generate a mapping 
    file for the FEDEFL. This file contains all of the accepted flowable and context 
    combinations which can be mapped to ReCiPe 1.1 characterization factors. It also 
    includes target UUID, units, and conversion factors as well as tracking 
    who mapped and verified each record and when they were last updated.

    
    FEDEFL contexts are mapped to ReCiPe 1.1 to enable impact assessment across most 
    of the possible contexts available within FEDEFL. Mappings that occur in the 
    primary contexts (e.g. air) are assigned to all possible sub-contexts which apply. 
    Where a context is non-specific in FEDEFL relative to the available ReCiPe 1.1 
    contexts (e.g. rural/urban), the LCIA Formatter applies the average of the 
    relevant characterization factors from ReCiPe 1.1.
    
    
    The LCIA Formatter generates a separate impact assement method for each of the 
    three approaches employed in ReCiPe 1.1, which includes Individualist, 
    Hierarchist, and Egalitarian. More details on the methods can be found on the 
    website https://www.rivm.nl/en/life-cycle-assessment-lca/downloads


    This mapping is representative of ReCiPe 1.1 endpoint impact factors. Midpoint 
    conversion factors are not included here.
